<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sazid Omi, a motivated rising senior at Queens College pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in computer 
  science. As an immigrant from Bangladesh who arrived a decade ago, my fascination with technology has continuously
  intensified. As a kid I would always tinker with my remote controlled toy cars. I was just so curious about what 
  was inside it that allowed it to move like it did. My curiosity only grew stronger when I moved to the USA and 
  discovered the world of gaming. I was really amazed by how many of these advanced games mechanics worked and how 
  people could have possibly made them. But as I grew older I slowly became captivated by the power of computers to 
  connect people across the globe, the emergence of artificial intelligence enhancing various aspects of our lives, 
  and the ability of machine learning to solve complex problems. This ever-growing passion has inspired my ambition 
  to excel as a successful software engineer and contribute to the world of technology in the future.

  I believe I have a knack for articulating complex ideas in a clear and concise manner, especially when I led 
  discussions in class and as a team member in various group projects about Java and C++. I also thrive in team 
  environments, which was evident in my CUNY Service Corps Internship as a Tech Intern when I had to bring together 
  a diverse group of co-interns and work together to finish an automation project using RPA software with limited 
  time and resources. Furthermore, my organizational skills and time management have allowed me to juggle the 
  demands of academic coursework, extracurricular activities, and my internship, all while maintaining a good GPA.

  I am currently looking for an internship that will help me to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in the 
  tech industry by collaborating with like-minded individuals and leveraging my skills and passion to contribute to 
  projects and innovation for a better future.
